Project Objectives

By the end of this project you will:

Gain knowledge of Watson IoT Platform.

Connecting IoT devices to the Watson IoT platform and exchanging the sensor data.

Gain knowledge on Cloudant DB

Gain Knowledge of geofence

Creating a Web Application through which the user interacts with the device.

Project Flow:

The GPS coordinates of the child will be sent to the IBM IoT platform

Location can be viewed in the Web Application

A parent can create a geofence in the web application

The web application will check if the child is inside or outside the geofence

Notifies the parents if the child goes out of the geofence

To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below:


Create and configure IBM Cloud Services

Create IBM Watson IoT Platform 

Create a device & configure the IBM IoT Platform

Create Node-RED service

Create a database in Cloudant DB to store location data

Develop a web Application using Node-RED Service.

Develop the web application using Node-RED

Integrate the geofence & google map

Develop a python script to publish the location details to the IBM IoT platform
